# Next Steps

- clean up all code
- make everything default export
- move all physics logic to a physics engine class
- refactor the number generator to not be stupid
- refactor out the event handler
- remove logic for forward and backward paddling


- I'm changing where the canoe polygon is iinitalized, and may have to redo this
